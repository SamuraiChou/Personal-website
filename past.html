	    <h2> General Experience with Computing </h2>
	    <p>From a young age, I was intrigued by computers and video games. Although I didnâ€™t initially grasp the technical details, my curiosity drove me to explore how hardware and software worked. Over time, this interest grew deeper. My passion for gaming led me to create small projects using Scratch, which sparked my initial interest in programming.</p>
	    
	    <h2> High School Experience </h2>
	    <p>High school provided me with foundational skills in IT. Through subjects like Information and Communication Technology (ICT), I gained experience using essential software such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Adobe Photoshop. These early lessons helped strengthen my understanding of computing fundamentals.</p>
